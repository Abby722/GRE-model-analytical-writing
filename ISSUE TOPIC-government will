Some people believe that government officials must carry out the will of the people they serve. Others believe that officials should
base their decisions on their own judgement.

ESSAY RESPONSE
Government officials have a responsibility to carry out the will of the people, but only to the extent that they still mainatain the 
established principlles of the state. In some cases, the will of the people stands solely on ideological grounds, and in these cases the
representatives and officials in question must remember that they do not only serve the people that elected them, but also the populace 
as a whole. When an official finds themselves in the unenviable position of having to make the choice between the will of the people and 
their own personal beliefs, officials must rely on their own good judgement to find the most prident alternative. While I agree that 
a government official should be held accountable for decisions made against the will of the people, the more serious infraction against
the people occurs when the official undermines the rule of law.
